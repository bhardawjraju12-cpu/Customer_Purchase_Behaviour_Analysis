## Project Steps

### 1. Data Loading & Exploration

* Loaded dataset using Pandas
* Performed initial inspection using `.info()` and `.describe()`
* Checked data types, distributions, and structure 

### 2. Data Cleaning & Preparation

* Handled missing values in *Review Rating* using median per category
* Standardized column names to snake_case
* Removed redundant column (*promo_code_used*)
* Verified data consistency across features

### 3. Feature Engineering

* Created **age_group** for customer segmentation
* Created **purchase_frequency_days** to analyze buying behavior

### 4. Database Integration

* Loaded cleaned dataset into PostgreSQL
* Prepared data for structured SQL analysis 

### 5. SQL Analysis

Performed business-focused queries to answer key questions:

* Revenue comparison by gender
* Identification of high-spending discount users
* Top-rated products based on customer reviews
* Shipping type impact on purchase behavior
* Subscriber vs. non-subscriber analysis
* Discount-dependent products
* Customer segmentation (New, Returning, Loyal)
* Top products by category
* Repeat buyers and subscription behavior
* Revenue contribution by age group

## Dashboard

* **Tool:** Power BI
* **Overview:** Interactive dashboard for visualizing customer behavior insights

### Key Metrics (from dashboard on page 5):

* Average Purchase Amount: **$59.76**
* Average Review Rating: **3.75**
* Total Customers: **3.9K** 

### Features:

* Revenue breakdown by category and age group
* Subscription distribution
* Sales by category
* Interactive filters (gender, category, shipping type)

## Results & Insights

* Male customers generated significantly higher revenue than female customers
* Certain products (e.g., gloves, sandals, boots) received the highest ratings
* Express shipping users had slightly higher average purchase values
* Majority of customers are non-subscribers, but they contribute substantial revenue
* Loyal customers drive the majority of purchases
* Younger and middle-aged groups contribute the highest revenue 

---

## Business Recommendations

* Increase subscription adoption through targeted incentives
* Implement loyalty programs to convert repeat buyers into loyal customers
* Optimize discount strategies to balance revenue and profit
* Promote top-performing and highly rated products
* Focus marketing efforts on high-value customer segments
